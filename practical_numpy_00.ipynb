Only check solutions *after* your code passes the tests.  \n","\n","2. **Your only resources are:**  \n","   - the **official NumPy documentation**,  \n","   - and the **notebook itself**.  \n","   You can play with the code, add debug prints, experiment like a real engineer does.  \n","   ❌ Do *not* use AI assistants or copy-pasted answers.  \n","   *(In Google Colab: disable AI completions via `Tools > Settings > AI Assistance > Show AI-powered inline completions`.)*  \n","\n","3. **When you get stuck — that’s the point.**  \n","   Stuck = learning.  \n","   This is where you train your ability to wrestle with problems, think deeply, and push through frustration.  \n","   That skill is valued everywhere from software engineering to AI research.\n","    > Your only extra help in case you struggle are the hints provided for each task. Use them sparingly — the less you rely on them, the more you’ll grow.\n","\n","\n","👉 Follow these rules, and you won’t just learn NumPy — you’ll train the **problem-solving mindset** that separates strong developers from tutorial zombies.  \n","<br></br>\n"],"metadata":{"id":"MEp98XqapgHc"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 🚀 What You’ll Need\n","- Python 3.x (local or Colab).  \n","- NumPy installed (`pip install numpy`).  \n","- A Jupyter/Colab notebook environment.  \n","\n","That’s it — no prior NumPy knowledge required.
